                <p class="card-text">The goal at Imbed LLC. was to design, develop
                    and improve digital cinema servers by increasing the native resolution,
                    increasing the frame rate of playback, and improve audio by increasing
                    the number and frequency of the audio channels. The project needed to stay within
                    the guidelines of digital cinema standards as defined by SMPTE(Society of Motion Picture
                    and Television Engineers).

                <p class="sub-title-text">Core Mechanics</p>
                <img src="..." alt="Dash and Jump Mechanics" class="card-img">
                <p class="card-text">From the start of the design, we knew we wanted to have a super jump and a dash,
                    allowing our players to utilize verticality at different points of the level would give them the chance
                    to escape the hordes of enemies that would chase them. Aside from the basic mechanics of firing a weapon,
                    moving and a basic jump, our choice of variance in gameplay would hinge on 2 different principles: the 
                    augmentation of a mechanic, or the replacement of it. This decision centered around the ideal that the
                    synergies the players would come up with match the playstyle of their core mechanics while also introducing
                    the first important element of roguelike/roguelite games which was the idea of a give-and-take.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Progression in roguelikes are always a hard thing to tackle, you don't want the player to feel too powerful,
                    and you don't want them to feel like they aren't improving either. From this mindset we came up with 2 parts of our core mechanic,
                    the first would be progression through a system of perks and the second a system of Augments. The perks would
                    serve as passive bonuses while the augments would enhance or replace existing mechanics in the game like jump and dash
                    with varied versions providing a stimulus effect that would entice the player to decide what kind of synergy they want to achieve.
                    Once we agreed upon how these systems would work and after the core mechanics of movement and combat were made, we moved on to
                    enhancing our weapons themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="sub-title-text">Weapon Development</p>
                <p class="card-text">All models in our games besides textures and materials are original models, crafted and themed
                    meticulously to the horror aspect of the game, we iterated through 2 different versions of combat before settling
                    on the system that would remain for the duration of our development stage. The first stage of weapon development was
                    to create bullet objects and have our hit detection and combat system be physics based, the game would wait for the bullet
                    to collide with an enemy hitbox before applying on-hit effects. After a few additions to the game, we realized that this system
                    would eventually fail us; we wanted to create an extremely fast-paced roguelike environment unlike one any game
                    has attempted, and the weapon system we had in place was too slow, required too many resources and ultimately was not scalable.
                    What we ended up doing was replacing the existence of our physics based hit software with a vector based one using
                    the Line Trace component provided by Unreal. Once we had included this system in the game, we decided to add a more
                    realistic visual effect of firing your weapon by creating a socket at the muzzle of the weapon which would be the origin point
                    for the audio track of the bullet itself, as well as a bullet tracer to provide a feedback system to the player to see where
                    exactly their bullets are hitting.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">The final last change to the overall infrastructure of our weapons was the creation of tools and templates to
                    improve the speed and functionality of newer weapons we wished to develop. I created a series of template components and actor objects
                    in the game that would ease the process of new weapons being developed by our designers and programmers in a way where the only programming
                    needed was the specific method of weapon firing, reload and weapon specific attributes. Once this tool was created, we developed our second weapon
                    and added it into the game in a short period of time. Once these weapons were developed and tested, the next step was to develop the first progression
                    system for the players, the perks.

                <p class="sub-title-text">Perk Component</p>
                <p class="card-text">The perk system was particularly interesting to develop, we had reached a point in our development where balancing was
                    becoming a more crucial aspect of gameplay. Our perk system was meant to enhance the player's basic attributes including but not limited to
                    movement speed, magazine side, and weapon damage. The architecture of the perk system hinges on a method of spawning an actor into the game once the room
                    was considered complete(all enemies dead). The actor itself that spawned would have target component attached to it, that once picked up by the player,
                    would recalculate one of the basic attributes mentioned above, and attaching it to the perk container managed by the main character's blueprints.
                    By attaching a component to handle the perk system on the player's character, we unlocked 2
                    elements of our gameplay that would be of vital importance to the overall experience, the first was progression and the second which was arguably more important
                    was a perk capacity. Allowing the player to receive and hold endless perks would turn the player into a god in the game, eventually reaching the point where
                    they would simply be unkillable in the basic room encounters. While our perk system was being developed, we were in the process of perfecting our ideal
                    level for the players.

                <p class="sub-title-text">Level Design</p>
                <p class="card-text">Level Design in the Ninth Circle was a particularly difficult aspect of our game. As of today, not many 3D roguelike games exist, and if
                    they did, they were never really noticeable or as large in popularity compared to other famous titles such as Hades and the Binding of Isaac. We had to make our
                    own attempt at discovering the formula for 3D level design in the roguelike genre, a painstaking process that took many level iterations before settling on a style
                    that fit the mechanics we served to the players.

                <p class="card-text">My next task was to parse and gather information from MXF files which were
                    responsible
