                <p class="card-text">The goal at Imbed LLC. was to design, develop
                    and improve digital cinema servers by increasing the native resolution,
                    increasing the frame rate of playback, and improve audio by increasing
                    the number and frequency of the audio channels. The project needed to stay within
                    the guidelines of digital cinema standards as defined by SMPTE(Society of Motion Picture
                    and Television Engineers).

                <p class="sub-title-text">XML and MXF Parsing</p>
                <img src="../../assets/xml-stock-photo.png" alt="XML Stock Photo" class="card-img">
                <p class="card-text">The first step was to develop code to accept digital cinema files
                    which came in the forms of XML(Extensible Markup Language) and MXF(Material Exchange Format) files.
                    The XML files defined the basic structure of movie playback and the order in which the reels need to
                    be sent to the digital projectors of cinema as well as packaging metadata required by the digital
                    cinema
                    projectors. Once the programs for compilation of the Composition playlists were complete, I moved on
                    to
                    parsing the subtitle files which came in XML format and prepared them to be played alongside video
                    and
                    audio frames by our playback engine.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">My next task was to parse and gather information from MXF files which were
                    responsible
                    for the transfer of video and audio data of a movie. These came in the form of encoded packets with
                    corresponding
                    keys designated by the standards of cinema. My job was to parse through these files in the form of a
                    breadth-first search algorithm, logging all keys and nested keys before identifying all necessary
                    packets. Once all the video and audio packets were identified in the tree, I extracted the audio
                    and frames into a folder to be used in digital playback.

                <p class="sub-title-text">Digital Playback Engine</p>
                <p class="card-text">The culmination of my work at Imbed was the digital playback engine. It required
                    the entirety
                    of my programs and parsers in order to function correctly. Using a cyclical buffer, we synchronized
                    the playback
                    of audio and video frames, and if the flag was set, played the subtitles in sync with the rest of
                    the movie. The
                    combination of these 3 projects provided the testing environment for the rest of the embedded
                    applications we would
                    include on the cinema server itself.
