                <p class="card-text">Quantum Leap is a rhythm-based Parkour Game where players can select the song they
                    wish
                    to play on, and most direct the character to land their jumps on a platform. The more platforms and
                    walls you
                    hit, the higher your score. The goal is to either beat the friend playing next to you on the couch,
                    or set a high
                    score for yourself.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Quantum Leap was the first game I ever developed in Unreal 5, the experience of using a powerful and
                    complex engine
                    opened my eyes to the possibilities of what could be done with the engine. It inspired me to develop
                    The Ninth Circle.

                <p class="card-text">Being a rhythm based game, the levels we needed to create needed to be extremely
                    meticulous. We started
                    by hand-crafting our levels and placing platforms and walls at constant distances. We soon realized
                    that this wasn't going to work,
                    if we wanted to add multiple playable songs to the game, we had to come up with a better way to
                    generate these platforms as well as their lengths
                    and distances. I discovered that a popular rhythm based game called OSU!, had a program that we
                    could use to generate a beat map. Once we tested out
                    a few songs in the beat map, we would import these beat maps into the game, and from the information
                    gathered by these beat maps, we would place platforms
                    and walls instead of buttons to click or hold sequences. Once we had perfected our system, we began
                    by creating the controls and basic infrastructure of
                    the core game loop.

                <hr>
                <p class="sub-title-text">Infrastructure</p>
                <img src="../../assets/quantum-leap-pic5.png" alt="Quantum Leap Gameplay Picture" class="card-img">
                <p class="card-text">The next step for myself and the team was to calculate the necessary jump height,
                    drops and pace of the game so that the
                    players would have the opportunity to actually land on the platform and score more points. We
                    effectively grouped all the platforms and walls
                    in the level, and since they were meant to be hit in a perfect sequence, we would iterate through
                    the list of objects step-by-step, analyzing the distance
                    and type of object we were going to hit. Once we managed to calculate these distances, we moved on
                    to creating the wall ride in the game.
                    Our wall ride is more of a visual effect than it is an actual wall ride. Because the player is never
                    meant to really turn their head down, we found
                    that the best way to add a wall ride in the game was to lock the camera to the wall, and slide the
                    camera across until the jump had to be triggered. With
                    a little camera tilt and arm sticking out towards the wall, we gave the idea to the player that they
                    were actually wall riding, and depending on the origin
                    height of the wall ride, the camera would slide across that point.
                </p>
                <img src="../../assets/quantum-leap-pic4.png" alt="Quantum Leap UI picture" class="card-img">
                <p class="card-text">The next step was to create the score system. Since we wanted our game to support
                    up to 4 players connected to the same system,
                    we created a UI panel to count the score and display it to the player. While the score counts up
                    passively, it jumps up based on the platforms hit,
                    how accurately the player hit the wall ride, and it increases based on a multiplier for the number
                    of platforms hit in sequence(the multiplier has a cap).
                    Once this was created, all we had left to do was texture the levels, make a cutscene for the
                    narrative of the game, and create a list of songs for the player to choose from.

                <img src="../../assets/quantum-leap-pic6.png" alt="Quantum Leap Ring Particles" class="card-img">
                <p class="card-text">Harnessing Unreal 5's graphical capabilities, we wanted to generate neon textures,
                    particle effects, and glows
                    on the platforms on a dark level for the player's immersion. We started by creating a ring in the
                    distance that the player approaches as they
                    get closer to the end of the level itself, and after learning the particle generator in Unreal
                    5(before Lumen), my colleagues and I were more equipped to create gradient colored particles.

                <p class="card-text">
                    After the design of the end ring, we moved on to creating the platforms and making the edges glow,
                    as well as making the plane of the level
                    reflective to align with the narrative of the game. By increasing the Bloom attributes of the
                    materials in the game, we were able to make a
                    glow powerful enough to reflect on a black mirror.

                <p class="card-text">
                    The last addition we made to particles and texturing was to give the player a surround particle
                    effect. By encompassing
                    in leaf type particles, we randomize the color and glow of the particles surrounding the player.
                    This was made possible
                    by the Niagra system provided by Unreal, it was the product of all of our knowledge on particle
                    generation, and texturing.
                    The final step was to add our narrative elements and create a menu for the player to select their
                    song.

                <p class="card-text">An artist on the team drew single frame drawings depicting what occured during the
                    game. The narrative is as follows,
                    your starship's engine ends up splitting reality, creating multiple copies of the player, the one
                    who reaches the end(highest score), becomes
                    the version of the main character that restores reality to its original dimension and closes all
                    other alternate dimensions, thus becoming,
                    the original. Our colleague created both a cut scene, and an end game cut scene before announcing
                    the winner.
