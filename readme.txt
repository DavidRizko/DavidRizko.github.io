--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?


JUSTIFICATION OF CSS ERRORS:
All my css errors are from the exact same problem which is not actually an issue at all. It stems from the fact that my background is contrasted badly with my text color,
but the bootstrap element I'm using, which is a card in all of my project pages, is using a color that puts an immense amount of focus onto words, contrary to what the
errors are trying to show. They all say the contrast difference needs to be checked, but essentially, it checks the wrong background color in comparison with the text color.
The other erros I am getting are text decoration problems of hyperlinks which I have found that changing them would actually confuse the user viewing the portfolio rather than
help them read it better.

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
I've added dozens of images of my game objects and code as proof of concept of a functioning game demo.
I've also created titles, headings and text div containers based on flex boxes to make my web pages for appealing.
I have navigation between many pages, and they all function as intended, leading to the proper pages, and using a CSS reset between each.
I have also added icons that embed links to other pages such as my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Itch.io.


(b) CSS features
I've added dozens of margins in specific areas to improve the readability of my pages. My front page has my
    about me text front and center along with all other resources like icons, a downloadable version of my resume,
    and an email icon that will automatically launch the clicker's email app and start composing an email to my email address.
I've removed text decoration completely from my portfolio cards and made the entire card clickable from anywhere so
    the user's don't have to click a certain button or text to route to the page they want to sea. I've also personalized
    every game page I made to the theme of the game by creating interesting(but still accessible) color palettes.
I used Bootstrap to create a navbar that will stick to the top of the page no matter how far down a user scrolls so that
    they do not have to scroll to the top of the page to move back, or require a button at the bottom of the page to show up
    that will bring the user back to the top of my page to navigate elsewhere.
I have also added custom fonts and experimented with different weights to focus the user's attention on things such as my name,
    the title of the game they are viewing, and separating text sections with sub-titles headers.

(c) Advanced features
My advanced features are embedded youtube links that autoplay when the page is opened, I have added this feature to
    the Quantum Leap page, and the Ninth Circle page. I was unable to embed a web-based playable demo of Retro Racer.
I would also consider all the icons as advanced features as they all route to other pages where I can be contacted,
    and as mentioned with the email above, clicking on the phone number will initiate copy my phone number to the clipboard.


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I would say I took about 36 hours trying to complete this assignment. I wanted my portfolio to be really good, and become
    something I would be proud of attaching to job applications to companies. Especially since I am game developer, a good website is needed
    to showcase work. I had to start from scratch a few times because my grasp on the fundamentals of html and css were not powerful
    and I ended up falling into bad habits when creating the first iteration of my web pages.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
https://getbootstrap.com/ --> For bootstrap elements
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp
https://colorhunt.co/
https://coolors.co/048a81-06d6a0-54c6eb-8a89c0-cda2ab
https://flexboxfroggy.com/ --> Super helpful

I also conducted google searches for company icons in the form of png's for Github, LinkedIn and Itch.io


5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
Benjamin Cates --> Helped me understand how the W3C validator works
Anthony Rizko --> Showed me some good practices for development of html and css pages. Also sent me a good tutorial
    for understanding flex boxes. Also helped me with making my page look aesthetically pleasing.
Daniel Rizko --> Helped and guided me through Bootstrap and showed me how to leverage Bootstrap components and elements,
    as well as modify them to fit my own personalization standards. He also helped me understand how variables work, and how
    to modify them without destroying the structure and format of my pages. Also helped me with making my page look aesthetically pleasing.

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Not that I know of, it should be all inside the files, and should work fine. My websites should also actually
    work responsively for mobile, I have made them in such a way that they can be read from a mobile device and
    fit aesthetically on any sized monitor(my monitor was an ultrawide and looked like crap initially).
